# CS-210-Project-Three

This project for my CS-210 class was meant to solve an issue where items purchased at a grocery store were recorded in a text file, with the name of the item listed for each occurrence.
I think that using python in the way that I did was a good way of getting around the complexity of C++ and ended up with a pretty efficient solution, both in terms of development time as well as compilation time. 
I think if this was created completely in C++, I could have written this more securely in terms of sanitizing input from the input text file as well as using C++'s features in order to prevent memory leaks. I think that figuring out the python code for this project was probably the most difficult part as I haven't worked with it in a little while and had to get reaquainted with the syntax as well as the functions of certain features like dictionaries. 
Pretty much all the skills learned here will be transferrable to further projects and will be used to build more complex applications. This project is maintainable based on the fact that I built it using modules that are self encapsulated and can be further refactored in order to make it more modular. This modularity allows us to fix and expand certain sections without having to mess with large amounts of code
